# animalaria

The code in this project accompanies an analysis to understand the relationship between domesticated animal ownership and _P. falciparum_ malaria infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has the world's second highest malaria burden and where animal husbandry is a key part of local economies and the population's livelihood. Survey and biospecimen data used in this project originate from the nationally representative 2013-14 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in DRC, which was the most recently conducted DHS as of October 2022. Survey data are publicly available by request from the DHS Program (https://dhsprogram.com/methodology/survey/survey-display-421.cfm), and Plasmodium biospecimen data are being made publicly available as well. 

This analysis is undergoing peer-review, and the accompanying citation will be added here when published.
